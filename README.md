# Halloween ðŸŽƒ

Some fun coding for our Halloween session ðŸ‘»ðŸ˜± The goal is to have an image or text react to the proximity (how close things are to the Enviro board) sensor.

Please add your Notebooks to this repository. *Include your name in the Notebook filename*. Any images you use should be uplaoded into the `Images` folder. You can copy `Example.ipynb` as a starting point. Do **not** commit changes to `Example.ipynb`.

Have fun!
